PeachPay is supercharging the WooCommerce checkout and payments experience.

== Description ==

**The team behind PeachPay is officially backed and funded by WooCommerce.**

Install PeachPay in minutes. Let your customers check out in seconds. See conversions rise and cart abandonment plummet in days.

The PeachPay extension delivers a frictionless checkout experience with one-click checkout.

Frictional checkout processes are a leading cause of cart abandonment. Customers crave a quick and easy checkout experience—often missing from online stores.

**What does PeachPay do?**

PeachPay, a WooCommerce-backed company, allows customers who use PeachPay, to buy with one click. The best part? It doesn’t matter if that customer initially checked out with PeachPay on your site or any other site that accepts PeachPay as a payment method. They’ll have a one-click checkout experience the next time and will be more likely to buy from your store.

* Adds a PeachPay Express Checkout button with no setup required to all product pages, cart page, checkout page, and mini/sidebar cart
* Returning customers have access to one-click checkout
* Customers with prior PeachPay purchases on other stores can purchase from your store with one click
* Test mode allows you to try PeachPay on your live site before customers see it
* Choose your button color, width, alignment, and more
* 3D Secure with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) support
* Instant payouts and zero-fraud guarantee through Stripe & PayPal
* Conveniently view orders in your existing store dashboard and payments in your existing Stripe & PayPal dashboards

**Benefits**

By removing friction from the checkout process, PeachPay reduces cart abandonment. Merchants using PeachPay almost always report reduced cart abandonment, increased conversions, and rising average order value. By making it easier for your customers to purchase from your site, sales and customer satisfaction increase.
