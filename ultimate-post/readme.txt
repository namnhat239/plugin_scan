First of all, PostX is well known for its 19 useful and customizable blocks that make it one of the best Gutenberg block plugins. You can use these blocks to organize your site's posts while displaying them (posts) on Home Page, and all Archive Pages that include Category Pages, Tag Pages, Search Pages, Date pages, etc. While or after adding them you can also customize them according to your need using the setting options which are available for all of the Gutenberg Blocks of PostX.

### 🏆 100+ Readymade Block Designs

We have created more than 100 ready-made designs that are available to import within a few clicks. So that, you don't need to work with the setting section. However, you are always welcome the customize the premade block designs as well if you want to.
 
### 🏆 Starter Packs
The premade block design may not be enough to create a complete home page because we need to combine them together to make a professional-looking Home page. So what to do?
Don't worry PostX got your back because it also comes with multiple premade templates named starter packs. All of these starter packs are made for creating a complete Home page for different niche-related sites. So that, with the starter packs the PostX plugin can be used as a home page builder.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-filter-posts-by-category-and-tag/" target="_blank">Ajax Filters</a> 

Do you want to let the visitors of your site filter posts by specific or multiple categories and tags? PostX offers ajax powered filter. So that, the visitors can explore more posts without reloading the whole posts.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ggGxr65788]

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-pagination/" target="_blank">Ajax Pagination</a> 

Ajax Paginations is similar to the Ajax filter that helps to explore posts without reloading the whole page. PostX offers three types of paginations for its blocks, which include Load More, Navigation, and Numeric pagination. We can use any of the available options and customize it according to our needs. 

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-query-builder/" target="_blank">Query Builder</a> 

The advanced Query Builder of postX helps the users to sort the posts and pages of the posts blocks. There are can be numerous criteria to sort posts, and the Query Builder covers all of the criteria, or I would say all major required criteria.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuGzILsO9rw]

### 🏆 Display Posts

As I have mentioned earlier, the query builder can sort posts, so you can decide and select the criteria to display posts within a block. For that, you can select desired categories, tags, or both of them at the same time. So that, the posts under those categories and tags will be displayed on the block. Furthermore, you can rearrange and organize them in ascending or descending order.

### 🏆 Display Pages

The Query Builder of PostX also allows displaying pages to the blocks. Once, we select the page option from the Sources section we will be able to choose the desired pages by typing the name of the pages.
 
 
### 🏆 Specific Posts 

The Specific Posts option of the Query Builder is used for selecting desired posts by typing the name of the posts. So that only selected posts will be displayed on the blocks.

### 🏆 Custome Selection (Posts and Pages)

The custom selection option helps you display posts and pages simultaneously by selecting them by typing the names.

### 🏆 Quick Query (Pro)

Quick Query is one of the main attractions of the Query Builder. It helps to quickly sort posts by different useful criteria including popular posts, recent posts, random posts, most commented posts, etc.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/popular-posts/" target="_blank"> Popular Posts</a> 

This option helps to display the popular posts on your desired block based on the view count of the posts. There are multiple criteria available for sorting the popular posts. The posts can be sorted by counting the views of 1, 7, or 30 days.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/how-to-show-related-posts-with-thumbnails-in-wordpress/" target="_blank"> Related Posts </a> 

Quick Query of the query builder also allows us to add related posts on single posts, pages, or on the sidebar with thumbnails using a widget based on category and tags. However, you can also use both category and tags at the same time as the criteria of related posts.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-recent-posts-with-thumbnails/" target="_blank">Latest/Recent Posts</a> 

By default, the post blocks of PostX display the latest or recently published posts. However, you can also display the recently modified posts as the latest posts.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzpIj4BGAkk]

### 🏆 Unique Content Group

Before sorting the posts of the blocks, it displays some posts by default. For this reason, it shows as the same posts if the users add the same block twice or more. To avoid this kind of circumstances we have to use the Content Group option. We have to add the same blocks under the same content group. So that, the posts will not be repeated.
 
 
### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/featured-slider/" target="_blank"> Home Page Slider </a> 

PostX has highly customizable responsive image slider blocks that we can use on our custom home page or any pages you want.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-breaking-news-ticker-for-postx/" target="_blank">The News Ticker</a> 

The News Ticker is a versatile feature for news magazine websites. Using this WordPress News Ticker, you can show the latest news and post elements with the built-in ticker variations and customizations.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/introducing-the-postx-global-styles/" target="_blank">Global Styles</a> 

Tired of the hassle of editing individual blocks? PostX Global Styles lets you edit colors, breakpoints, and editor size globally, allowing you to create proper news, magazine, and portfolio websites with ease.

### PostX Addons

If the features are not enough for your site you can start using the addons of PostX to add more functionalities that are reauired to create News Magazine or any kinds of blogs.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/builder/" target="_blank">Archive Builder Addon (Pro)</a>

The Builder addon for PostX helps to create custom templates for the category, taxonomy, author, search and date pages, and in short, 
all archive pages. So that, the default templates of the WordPress theme will be replaced with the new templates. 
We can create one single template for all of the archive pages or unique templates for each of the pages.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/elementor/" target="_blank">Elementor Addon</a>

The Elementor addon is for those users who want to add the blocks of PostX while editing the page. For that, 
you have to use both of the save templates and Elementor at the save time to create a custom design with PostX blocks and save it as a template, 
later use the template while editing the page with Elementor.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/category/" target="_blank">Category Addon</a>

As we know, we can not add featured images for categories. However, we can not only add images but also add category-specific colors using the Category addon. 

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd75q-lJIwg]

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/save-template/" target="_blank">Save Templates</a>

It can help us to create unique design and save it as templates. Later we can also use the template anywhere, anytime using shortcode. These templates are even supported on popular page builders like Elementor.


### 🏆 SEO Addons

PostX has integration with major SEO plugins that include <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/yoast/" target="_blank">Yoast</a>, <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/rankmath/" target="_blank">RankMath</a>, <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/seopress/" target="_blank">SEOPress</a>, <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/squirrly/" target="_blank">Squirrly</a>, <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/all-in-one-seo-meta/" target="_blank">All in One SEO</a>. The intent of this integration is to replace the default meta description or excerpt with the custom meta description written with the SEO addons.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/save-template/" target="_blank">Reading Progress Bar</a>

The Reading Progress bar displays a visual indication of the reading progression to the readers. So the readers can easily understand how much they have read and how long it will take to finish it.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/table-of-content/" target="_blank"> Table Of Content</a>

Table of Contents helps the readers to get an overview of blog posts and click on the heading to jump to their desired section of the posts. The TOC block of the postx is a complete solution with all customization options and required features.
