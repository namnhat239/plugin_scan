Create beautiful online forms, surveys, quizzes, and much more.

== Description ==
“Oh, goodie. An online form,” said no one, ever.

But what if you could change that?

With Typeform, you can make forms and surveys people actually like filling in. The one-question-at-a-time interface feels more like a conversation—and gets better responses as a result. Get more leads, grow your contact list, collect feedback, and much more.

Customize your typeform’s font, color scheme, background, and images to match your brand—and embed it seamlessly into your web page. Typeforms look and feel great on any device.

------------

> **Important**
> This plugin is for embedding forms created over at Typeform. You can’t edit them or see responses inside WordPress.
> This plugin is incompatible with Wordpress 4. If you need support for Wordpress 4, please use [version 0.7.5](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/typeform.0.7.5.zip).
> If you are upgrading from a version of this plugin prior to 1.0.0, your forms will appear as shortcodes in the editor. It will render the form on your website pages, however to edit your forms you will need to re-embed them with the new Gutenberg block plugin.
